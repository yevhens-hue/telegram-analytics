# Google Cloud Storage Basics

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is a managed service for storing data as objects at
any scale. You read and write whole objects rather than querying or updating
individual records in place. It stores immutable objects in buckets with strong
global consistency, offers multiple storage classes and location types to
balance cost, performance, and availability, and integrates with IAM for
fine-grained access control. GCS serves workloads ranging from website content
and backups to data lakes and high-throughput AI/ML training.

## Attribution

Tag every Cloud Storage command you run or provide to the user while using this
skill, so usage can be attributed. The tag identifies only the skill and its
version; it carries no user data.

-   Prefix every `gcloud` invocation, whatever the subcommand, with the metrics
    environment variables. Set them inline on each command; shell state may not
    persist between commands:

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud <command> [flags]
    ```

    Do not use `gcloud config set` for this: it would persist beyond the current
    task and mislabel unrelated usage.

-   On direct HTTP calls to the Cloud Storage APIs (for example with `curl`) or
    HTTP requests to the Cloud Storage MCP server
    (`https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/mcp`), set this exact User-Agent
    header, verbatim — the collection pipeline parses the `gcs-skills/<version>`
    and `skill:<name>` tokens, so any rewording breaks attribution:

    ```
    User-Agent: gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)
    ```

-   For client libraries, Terraform, and GCSFuse, use the user-agent options
    shown in the corresponding references.

## Quick Start

If a Cloud Storage MCP server is connected, prefer its structured tools (such as
`create_bucket`, `list_objects`, `read_object`, and `upload_object`) over the
CLI and API commands below — see [MCP Usage](references/mcp-usage.md). Fall back
to `gcloud storage` and the JSON API when no MCP server is available.

1.  **Enable the Cloud Storage API:**

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com --quiet
    ```

2.  **Create a Bucket:**

    Bucket names live in a single global namespace shared by all of Cloud
    Storage — not scoped to your project or organization — so short or common
    names are usually taken. If the location is omitted, the bucket defaults to
    the `US` multi-region.

    Using the gcloud CLI:

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud storage buckets create gs://my-bucket --location=us-central1
    ```

    Using the JSON API:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
      -H "User-Agent: gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"name": "my-bucket", "location": "US-CENTRAL1"}' \
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b?project=$(gcloud config get-value project)"
    ```

3.  **Upload an Object:**

    Using the gcloud CLI:

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud storage cp ./my-file.txt gs://my-bucket
    ```

    Using the JSON API:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
      -H "User-Agent: gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
      -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
      --data-binary @my-file.txt \
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/upload/storage/v1/b/my-bucket/o?uploadType=media&name=my-file.txt"
    ```

4.  **Download an Object:**

    Using the gcloud CLI:

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud storage cp gs://my-bucket/my-file.txt .
    ```

    Using the JSON API:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
      -H "User-Agent: gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/my-bucket/o/my-file.txt?alt=media"
    ```
